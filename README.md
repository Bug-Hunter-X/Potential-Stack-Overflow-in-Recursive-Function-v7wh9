This repository contains a Hack code example demonstrating a potential stack overflow error caused by unbounded recursion. The `foo` function calculates the factorial but lacks proper input validation, leading to infinite recursion if called with negative numbers. The `bar` function acts as a wrapper, but doesn't handle the negative input case appropriately.  The solution provides corrected input validation to prevent the stack overflow.
